# ✅ To-Do List Web App

This is a simple and elegant **To-Do List Web Application** built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It allows users to add, check/uncheck, and delete tasks. The app also saves the list in the browser's local storage so that your tasks remain intact even after refreshing the page.

## ✨ Features

- ➕ Add new tasks
- ✅ Mark tasks as completed (strike-through effect)
- ❌ Delete individual tasks
- 💾 Tasks are saved in **local storage**
- 🎨 Responsive and aesthetic UI with gradient background

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML5** – Structure of the app
- **CSS3** – Styling and layout
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** – Core functionality (Add, Check, Delete, Save)


## 🚀 How to Run

1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open `note.html` in your preferred browser.
3. Start adding your tasks!

## 💡 How It Works

- Clicking the **"Add"** button adds a new task to the list.
- Clicking on a task toggles the **checked** style.
- Clicking the **"×"** symbol deletes the task.
- All tasks are saved in **local storage**, so they remain after refresh or reopen.
